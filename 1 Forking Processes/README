PURPOSE: Project 1 forking processes

Description:

To use this program input the following parameters (n,s,t) followed by a number 

./oss -n 5 -t 3 -s 2

n: represents the number of processes you wish to create

t: represents the total number of iterations to run each process

s: represents the number of processes you wish to run simultaneously, 
  if you have more processes your simultaneous max, the program will wait for a process to finish before running the next

You can also call this program with the -h to open a help menu

This program will output the PID of the process, pid of the parent, and the number of iterations before and after waiting 1 second intervals

Additionally, it will print to the screen every time a process finishes executing

To compile the project just use make from the make file. It will compile both files into seperate executables (oss,user)

I used the code provided in canvas for the make file but i modified it to work with my file names

I also used git to manage the version control for this project
